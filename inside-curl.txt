What's Their Behind Curl Command ?

-->

Here's a detailed breakdown of what happens when you execute a `curl` command in the terminal:

1. **Command Parsing**
- Shell parses the `curl` command
- Identifies the URL, HTTP method, and any additional flags/parameters
- Prepares network request parameters

2. **DNS Resolution**
- Kernel's resolver library initiates DNS lookup
- Checks local DNS cache first
- Queries configured DNS servers (usually `/etc/resolv.conf`)
- Converts domain name to IP address using recursive/iterative DNS resolution

3. **Socket Creation**
- Operating system creates a network socket
- Allocates kernel-level socket descriptor
- Chooses an available local port number for the connection

4. **TCP Connection Establishment**
- Three-way TCP handshake occurs:
  1. Client sends SYN packet with initial sequence number
  2. Server responds with SYN-ACK packet
  3. Client sends final ACK packet
- Establishes full-duplex TCP connection
- Negotiates Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
- Sets up congestion control parameters

5. **SSL/TLS Negotiation** (for HTTPS)
- Performs TLS handshake if HTTPS
- Exchanges cryptographic parameters
- Verifies server's SSL certificate
- Establishes encrypted communication channel
- Agrees on symmetric encryption keys

6. **HTTP Request Generation**
- Constructs complete HTTP request
- Includes headers (User-Agent, Accept, etc.)
- Adds any request body/payload
- Formats request according to HTTP protocol specifications

7. **Data Transmission**
- Breaks request into TCP segments
- Sends data through network stack
- Manages packet fragmentation
- Handles network layer routing

8. **Server Processing**
- Remote server receives TCP packets
- Reconstructs HTTP request
- Processes request
- Generates HTTP response

9. **Response Transmission**
- Server sends response back through network
- TCP ensures reliable, ordered packet delivery
- Manages congestion control
- Handles potential packet loss/retransmission

10. **Local Processing**
- Curl receives response packets
- Reassembles complete HTTP response
- Processes response headers
- Displays/handles response body based on command options

Key Networking Concepts Involved:
- TCP/IP protocol suite
- DNS resolution
- Socket programming
- Network routing
- Packet switching
- SSL/TLS encryption
- HTTP/HTTPS protocols

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this process?
